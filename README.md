# Spotify Lyrics Viewer Online
View the lyrics of the current playing Spotify song in your browser

## Plan
- Send title, artist and album for lyrics from server to client
    - Display these at the bottom
    - Link to genius page also
- Highlighter input to find current position: https://markjs.io/
- Better looking non-playing track components

### Frontend
- Bright fluorescent colours as the background with black/white text
    - Random on each entry but configurable in settings.
    - Background colour pulse/transition option
- Album art, song name, the artist at top (option to hide this). Lyrics down the page vertically (middle).
- No need for a nav as there is only one page

#### Settings tab
- Refresh button?
